./merb-core/tools/allison-2.0.2:
    Merb incorporates the allison library, but it is removed by the repack
    script because the AFL license is not free software per the Debian Free
    Software Guidelines. See README.source.

    allison is Copyright 2007 Cloudburst, LLC

./merb-core/tools/allison-2.0.2/lib/allison.css
    This file is not redistributable and is removed by the repack script so it

    You can redistribute it and/or modify it under either the terms of the GPL
    (see COPYING.txt file), or the conditions below:

      1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
         software without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the
         original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

      2. You may modify your copy of the software in any way, provided that
         you do at least ONE of the following:

           a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise
              make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
    	  modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or by allowing
    	  the author to include your modifications in the software.

           b) use the modified software only within your corporation or
              organization.

           c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    	  with standard executables, which must also be provided.

           d) make other distribution arrangements with the author.

      3. You may distribute the software in object code or executable
         form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

           a) distribute the executables and library files of the software,
    	  together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)
    	  on where to get the original distribution.

           b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    	  the software.

           c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, with
              instructions on where to get the original software distribution.

           d) make other distribution arrangements with the author.

      4. You may modify and include the part of the software into any other
         software (possibly commercial).  But some files in the distribution
         are not written by the author, so that they are not under this terms.

         They are gc.c(partly), utils.c(partly), regex.[ch], st.[ch] and some
         files under the ./missing directory.  See each file for the copying
         condition.

      5. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
         output from the software do not automatically fall under the
         copyright of the software, but belong to whomever generated them,
         and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
         software.
