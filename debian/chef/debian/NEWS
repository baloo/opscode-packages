chef (0.9.12+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

    * When upgrading the chef-server from 0.9.8 or earlier versions in the
      0.9.x series, the package needs to be installed before the chef package
      if the chef package is installed and the chef-client daemon is running
      because the checksum_path setting in `/etc/chef/server.rb` conflicts
      with the cache_options setting in `/etc/chef/client.rb`. A fixed bug
      in Chef 0.9.10 causes the files in the checksum_path to be removed and
      on the chef-server that is where the uploaded cookbooks are stored.
    * The checksum clearing code (from 0.9.10) mentioned above may take a very
      long time to execute depending on how many files have been stored in the
      cache on the system. The default location is specified by the
      cache_options setting in /etc/chef/client.rb. If there are a lot of
      files in this directory then it may be desirable to delete the contents
      of the directory before updating Chef.
    * knife now (as of 0.9.10) has a new subcommand `exec` that can be used to
      execute API commands similar to those used by shef. For more information
      see the Shef wiki page (also listed in 0.9.8 news below).
    * Resource notifications have been revamped to be more simple to use and
      will work better overall. See the wiki page for complete syntax.

chef (0.9.8+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Important changes in 0.9.8:

    * chef-server and chef-server-webui processes will be named accordingly in
      ps output.
    * Chef can now be configured to use an http/https proxy with the
      `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` variables.
    * Chef now saves expanded run list and role list to the `recipes` and
      `roles` attributes on the node object.
    * Chef's REPL, `shef` now supports its own configuration file. See:

chef (0.9.6+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  When upgrading from Chef 0.8.x to 0.9.x, be aware of a couple important changes.

    * 0.9 clients can read from 0.8 servers, but cannot save to 0.8 servers.
    * 0.8 clients cannot read or save from / to 0.9 servers.
    * The cookbook upload method is changed and cookbooks have to be
      uploaded to the server again.

  First, upgrade the server packages. Then upgrade the clients.

  Once the server is upgraded, cookbooks need to be uploaded again. Typically
  this is done from the Chef Repository (chef-repo) with knife. If the Chef
  Server is where the repository is located, simply:

      knife cookbook upload -a

  In the local chef-repo directory. If the repo is on another workstation,
  then upgrade Chef there and run the knife command, above.

  Two new configuration values are added to the server.rb:

    * sandbox_path
    * checksum_path

  Which are used for the new cookbook upload scheme.
