Gecode includes examples/scowl.hpp, which has wordlists taken from
SCOWL, english-55.  Excerpt from the included README:

  Spell Checking Oriented Word Lists (SCOWL)
  Revision 6
  August 10, 2004
  by Kevin Atkinson

  The SCOWL is a collection of word lists split up in various sizes, and
  other categories, intended to be suitable for use in spell checkers.
  However, I am sure it will have numerous other uses as well.

  The latest version can be found at http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/

  COPYRIGHT, SOURCES, and CREDITS:
  
  The collective work is Copyright 2000-2004 by Kevin Atkinson as well
  as any of the copyrights mentioned below:

    Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute and sell these word
    lists, the associated scripts, the output created from the scripts,
    and its documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee,
    provided that the above copyright notice appears in all copies and
    that both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
    supporting documentation. Kevin Atkinson makes no representations
    about the suitability of this array for any purpose. It is provided
    "as is" without express or implied warranty.
  
  Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> also deserves special credit as he has,
  in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major
  contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of
  feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the
  Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.
  
  The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to
  the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most
  common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and
  frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist
  with Frequency Classification".
  
  The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:
  
      The Moby lexicon project is complete and has
      been place into the public domain. Use, sell,
      rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.
  
      Placing this material on internal or public servers is
      also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any
      export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide.
  
      You can verify the public domain status by contacting

  The "UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification" is also in the
  Public Domain:
  
    Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100
    From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk>
  
    > I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English
    > Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to
    > be lacking any copyright notice.
  
    There were many many sources in total, but any text marked
    "copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one
    source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called
    PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public
    domain.
  
    Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100
  
    > So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?
  
    That is the intention.
  
  The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.
  
  The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at
  least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All
  words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via
  my inflection database.
  
  The 12Dicts package and Supplement is in the Public Domain.

  Inflections database, is under the following copyright:

  The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0
  of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the
  public domain.
  
  The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words words appearing
  in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts
  package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12
  dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The
  top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a
  list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added
  myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in
  other word lists is included.
  
  The name files form the Census report is a government document which I
  don't think can be copyrighted.
  
  The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the
  "Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon
  File".  All of which is in the Public Domain.  This file also contain
  a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the
  special/ directory.
  
  The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version
  4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also
  in the public domain.
