Description: fast_xs provides C extensions for escaping text
 fast_xs provides C extensions for escaping text.
 .
 The original String#fast_xs method is based on the xchar code by Sam Ruby:
 .
 * http://intertwingly.net/stories/2005/09/28/xchar.rb
 * http://intertwingly.net/blog/2005/09/28/XML-Cleansing
 .
 _why also packages an older version with Hpricot (patches submitted).
 The version here should be compatible with the latest version of Hpricot
 code.
 .
 Ruby on Rails will automatically use String#fast_xs from either Hpricot
 or this gem version with the bundled Builder package.
 .
 String#fast_xs is an almost exact translation of Sam Ruby's original
 implementation (String#to_xs), but it does escape "&quot;" (which is an
 optional, but all parsers are able ot handle it.  XML::Builder as
 packaged in Rails 2.0 will be automatically use String#fast_xs instead
 of String#to_xs available.
